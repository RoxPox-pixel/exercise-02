    <h2>This is the second exercise from the homework for 29 September 2024</h2> <br>
    <p>In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-02. <br>
       Inside the folder, add index.html & main.js files. The exercise should implement the following problem: <br> <br>

        The user provides a number. The program should display two distinct output messages: if the given number is divisible by 3 (first output) and if the number is divisible by 5 (second output) <br><br>
        
        Example: 
        Input value: 6
        First output message: “6 is divisible by 3”
        Second output message: “6 is not divisible by 5” <br><br>
        
        After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository (use a descriptive name for the commit)</p>
