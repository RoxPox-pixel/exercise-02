# exercise-02


In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-02. 
Inside the folder, add index.html & main.js files. The exercise should implement the following problem:


The user provides a number. The program should display two distinct output messages: if the given number is divisible by 3 (first output) and if the number is divisible by 5 (second output)


Example: 
Input value: 6
First output message: “6 is divisible by 3”
Second output message: “6 is not divisible by 5”

After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository (use a descriptive name for the commit)
